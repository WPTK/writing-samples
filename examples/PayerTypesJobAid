<summary>What I Need To Know</summary>
<p>The following information applies to this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance is a contractual relationship in which one party pays another party to assume the risk of a defined set of future events. It may apply to a:
<ul>
<li>Limited or comprehensive range of medical services</li>
<li>Full or partial payment of the cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health insurance can be placed into three different categories:
<ul>
<li>Private</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>

<summary>Private Health Insurance</summary>
<p>The following information applies to private health insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private health care offers alternatives to government run public health care systems.</li>
<li>Private health care operates:
<ul>
<li>Outside of government control</li>
<li>Only receives funds from:
<ul>
<li>Patients</li>
<li>Their insurance policies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Private health insurance can be offered through:
<ul>
<li>An employer who pays the majority of the premiums</li>
<li>An individual health plan as an option</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>Individual means the insurance is&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong> connected to a business or the employer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Private health insurance can be broken down into the following two categories:
<ul>
<li>Traditional Indemnity Plans</li>
<li>Managed Care Plans</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<details open="open" class="mce-accordion">
<summary>Traditional Indemnity Plans (Fee-For-Service Plans)</summary>
<p>The following applies to Traditional Indemnity Plans:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Traditional plans are plans covering health care under which payment is nearly automatic and oversight procedures are minimal.</li>
<li>Normally require payment of medical expenses in the form of a deductible or out of pocket amount before the insurance company pays the majority of the bill.</li>
<li>The advantage of this type of plan is that the insured has complete autonomy when it comes to choosing a provider of care.</li>
<li>Authorization from a primary care physician (PCP) referral is&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;normally required.</li>
<li>The disadvantage to this plan is that the insurance company pays a percentage of what it considers Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR).</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open="open" class="mce-accordion">
<summary>Managed Care Plans</summary>
<p>The following applies to managed care plans:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Managed Care Plans involve an arrangement between:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The insurer</li>
<li>A selected network of health care providers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are three types of Managed Care Plans</li>
</ul>
<details open="open" class="mce-accordion">
<summary>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)</summary>
<p>The following applies to HMO:</p>
<ul>
<li>HMO is the least:
<ul>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In exchange for lower insurance premiums, only in-network providers can be used for coverage.</li>
<li>A Primary Care Physician (PCP):
<ul>
<li>Normally manages the care.</li>
<li>Referral and/or precertification from the insurance company are required for services.</li>
<li><b>MUST</b>&nbsp;obtain the referral for AHG to service, if applicable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accredo Health Group (AHG)&nbsp;<b>MUST</b>&nbsp;verify:
<ul>
<li>The policy type during the benefit investigation.</li>
<li>the PCP referral is on file before dispensing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Policy types&nbsp;<b>MUST</b>&nbsp;be documented in the Insurance Profile screen of RxHome.</li>
<li>HMO referrals can&nbsp;<b>NOT</b>&nbsp;be backdated.</li>
<li>Start and stop dates for HMO referrals&nbsp;<b>MUST</b>&nbsp;be documented.</li>
<li>Approval time frame:
<ul>
<li>From the PCP can vary by payer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>MUST</b>&nbsp;be:
<ul>
<li>Validated.</li>
<li>Documented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HMO Policy type authorization for medication:
<ul>
<li>An HMO referral is an approval for the patient to see the specialist that AHG received the prescription from.</li>
<li>A PCP referral for an HMO policy type is&nbsp;<b>NOT</b>&nbsp;related to the health plan's authorization requirement for a specific medication, but AHG&nbsp;<b>MUST</b>&nbsp;follow the health plan's authorization requirements.</li>
<li>A PCP referral number and/or dates&nbsp;<b>MUST</b>&nbsp;be documented in the chart notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preventive care is almost always covered at 100% with a copayment for each appointment.</li>
<li>In general, HMO plans have an unlimited lifetime maximum.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>ONLY</b>&nbsp;disadvantage is that the insured is financially responsible for any services rendered out of the HMO network.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open="open" class="mce-accordion">
<summary>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)</summary>
<p>The following applies to PPO:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>PPO plans allow for more flexibility at a slightly higher cost when compared to an HMO policy.</li>
<li>PPO plans offer both in and out of network coverage giving the insured more options when choosing healthcare providers.</li>
<li>In-network coverage offers a smaller coinsurance that gives the insured an incentive to choose providers within the PPO network.</li>
<li>Specialist can be seen without PCP involvement or prior notification.</li>
<li>PPO rules for coverage can be complex so it is best to verify what types of services are covered before picking this type of insurance plan.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open="open" class="mce-accordion">
<summary>Point of Service (POS)</summary>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The POS plan has attributes of both the HMO and PPO plan.</li>
<li>The POS plan is like an HMO plan because a PCP referral is usually required to see the specialist or provider.</li>
<li>
<p>It is like a PPO plan because the insured has the option of coverage:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In network</li>
<li>Out of network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a higher in network benefit level that encourages the use of in network providers but the insured can go outside of the network usually at a higher cost.</li>
<li>
<p>POS plans normally cover:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>More preventive care services</li>
<li>May offer improvement programs such as health club discounts.</li>
</ul>
